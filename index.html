            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
              Over 60 years ago, a milk truck driver in northern New York
              complained to Julius S채mann about the smell of spilled milk.
              S채mann had lived and worked in the Canadian pine forests
              researching the extraction of aromatic oils from pine needles.
              <span class="read-more-text"
                >He went to work and, using exceptional fragrances on specialty
                material, soon invented the first automotive air freshener.
                Julius S채mann gave his product the shape of a pine tree, and the
                first Wunder-Baum air freshener was born.</span
